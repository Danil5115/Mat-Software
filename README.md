# Mathematical Software

# Project Description

This is my project repository where I've gathered various code segments related to different topics. Each code segment addresses specific tasks and utilizes a variety of libraries for efficient execution. Below, I'll provide a brief overview of each code segment in this repository and the libraries used.

## 1. Knihovny a moduly pro matematické výpočty.ipynb
This notebook covers libraries and modules used for mathematical computations. It explores different math-related operations, making use of the following libraries:
- `time`
- `numpy`
- `scipy.special`
- `math`
- `sympy`


## 2. VizualizaceDat

This section focuses on data visualization. It provides code for creating visual representations of data using libraries such as `pandas`, `seaborn`, and `matplotlib.pyplot`. Here's a brief overview of the data visualizations included in this section:

### 1. Area distribution of age between surviving and non-surviving passengers
- The code loads data from a CSV file and creates a kernel density plot (kdeplot) to visualize the age distribution among passengers, differentiating between survivors and non-survivors.
- Libraries used: `pandas`, `seaborn`, `matplotlib.pyplot`

### 2. Survivor vs. dead by class
- This code creates a countplot to visualize the number of survivors and non-survivors based on passenger class.
- Libraries used: `seaborn`, `matplotlib.pyplot`

### 3. Correlation between age and ticket price
- The code presents a scatterplot to explore the correlation between passengers' age and ticket fares.
- Libraries used: `seaborn`, `matplotlib.pyplot`

### 4. Correlation between class, gender and survival
- This part generates a heatmap to visualize the relationship between passenger class, gender, and survival using a contingency table.
- Libraries used: `pandas`, `seaborn`, `matplotlib.pyplot`

### 5. Distribution of surviving and non-surviving passengers
- The code counts the number of survivors and non-survivors and creates a pie chart to display the distribution.
- Libraries used: `matplotlib.pyplot`

### 6. Ticket price distribution
- This code plots a histogram to visualize the distribution of ticket prices.
- Libraries used: `matplotlib.pyplot`

### 7. Age and class distribution by gender
- The code uses a violin plot to display the distribution of age and class based on gender. The "inner" parameter shows quartiles to evaluate the data distribution shape.
- Libraries used: `seaborn`

These visualizations offer insights into various aspects of the dataset and demonstrate the power of data visualization in data analysis and interpretation. You can explore and adapt this code to your specific data visualization needs.


## 3. Úvod do lineární algebry .ipynb
In this notebook, you'll find an introduction to linear algebra concepts. The code snippets included here utilize various mathematical operations, often involving:
- `numpy`
- `scipy.special`
  

## 5. Hledání kořenů rovnice .ipynb
This notebook deals with root-finding in equations. It contains code to find the roots of equations and uses libraries like:
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib.pyplot`

## 6. Generování náhodných čísel a testování generátorů .ipynb
This section focuses on generating random numbers and testing random number generators. It involves libraries like:
- `random`
- `time`
- `hashlib`

## 8. Derivace funkce jedné proměnné .ipynb
This notebook explores derivatives of single-variable functions. It demonstrates the use of mathematical concepts and makes use of libraries such as:
- `numpy`
- `scipy.special`

These code segments collectively cover a wide range of mathematical and data analysis topics. I have put this collection together on my behalf to facilitate learning and experimentation in these areas. Feel free to explore each section and utilize the provided code for your own projects.
